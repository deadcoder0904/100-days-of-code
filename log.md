# 100 Days Of Code - Log

# [Blog Site](http://deadcoder0904.github.io/100dayz/)

### Day 1: November 1st, 2016 (Example 1)

**Today's Progress**: Created a new Blog in Hexo.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled in writing Bash Scripts & setting up the Blog, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Now I can write each Blog Post for the next 99 dayz & deploy with just 1 script.
