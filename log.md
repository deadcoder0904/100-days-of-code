### Day 1: November 1st, 2016 (Example 1)

**Today's Progress**: Created a new Blog in Hexo.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled in writing Bash Scripts & setting up the Blog, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Now I can write each Blog Post for the next 99 dayz & deploy with just 1 script.

### Day 2: November 2nd, 2016 (Example 2)

**Today's Progress**: Created First App In Electron.

**Thoughts:** I knew basic HTML, CSS & JavaScript. So it was very easy to create my first Electron App.

### Day 3: November 3rd, 2016 (Example 3)

**Today's Progress**: Created Markdown Desktop and Packaged it for Distribution.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled in throught Packaging/Distributing the App as it was downloading electron again & again. But, creating a Markdown Previewer was a childish play for me.
